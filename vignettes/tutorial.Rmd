template
========


This repository is simply a template for my projects. It is structured as an [R package],
with a few additions:

- Development and version history hosted on [Github]
- a [manuscripts] directory, for writing R-markdown manuscripts and
building them into pdfs and other formats using [pandoc]. 
- Continuous integration and testing using [Travis CI]. 

(These are excluded when building the R package, see .Rbuildignore)



At this time, most of the template is dedicated to functions for dynamic
documentation of the manuscript.  See [manuscripts/README] for more
details about this functionality.  


**Note**: This README is created programmatically from [vignettes/tutorial.Rmd],
so edit that file and not the README itself.  (This lets the README include 
executed R code and keeps it in sync with an R package vignette).
